Toaster is designed to be a integrated test environment.
What's special of Toaster is that it uses AOP technology to trace the program's running information at real time.
Toaster is developed with Java RCP, and it uses AspectC++ to realise the AOP functions, which means it's oriented to C++ programs only.
